            Deploying an update the load balancer is used to check the health of new containers before considering them reading.
          Target Groups have HealthyThreshold (5) and Interval (30) which means the LB will need to make 5 calls that succeed before considering the container ready, these defaults result in a 2 minute 30 second wait.
        </p>
      <p>
        When old containers are being torn down the LB also has a delay for keep-alive connections to finish.
        This is called the deregistraion delay and its default it 5 minutes.

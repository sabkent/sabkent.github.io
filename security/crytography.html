        <h3>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</h3>
        <p>
            Takes 128 bits of plaintext and produces 128 bit cipher text
            These fixed size blocks are why this is a block cipher
            A Block Cipher with a Key is technically called a permutation, but permutation is a mapping from every
            128
            bit plaintext to cipher text.
            The memory for that permutation dictionary is impractical, AES acts like a pseudorandom permitation
        </p>
        <p>
            The 128 bit plaintext is 16 bytes which is represented as 4x4 matrix column first fill

        </p>
        <p>
            AES passes plaintext through round functions multiple times to encrypt.
            The round function consists of the following operations:
            SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey. All the operation are reverable except for the last one
            which is an XOR with the round key
        </p>
        <p>
            All block cipher deal with fixed block size so when your data doesn't
            fit padding is used. A block is 16 bytes if your data was 8 bytes then you
            would need 8 bytes of padding... so the padding value of 8 is written 8 times to pad.
            If no padding was required by your data then a complete block (16 bytes) of value 16 would be appended
            This is the most popular approach and is standardized in PKCS#7 padding
        </p>
        <p>
            Mode of operation
            ECB electronic codebook is a naive implementation whereby the plaintext is broken into 16 bytes blocks
            the same plaintext results in the same ciphertext (permutation)
            so the cipher can reveal repeating patterns (ECB Penguin)
        </p>
        <p>
            So a better mode is CBC Cipher block chaining
            This requires an IV intialization vector, this is a random bit of data the size of the block
            The first block is XOR with the IV before encrypting
            The resulting cipher text then becomes the IV for the next block
            Nothing is leaked by revealing the IV and so it is transmitted with the ciphertext in plaintext
        </p>
        <p>
            AES is authenciated by using HMAC over ciphertext and IV, this is Encrypt-then-MAC,
            the alternative MAC-then-Encrypt opens up attack vector.
            The resultant authentication tag is transmitted along with cipher text and IV
            in the order IV CIPHER TAG. This combination is called AES-CBC-HMAC and has been replaced but is still
            widely in use
        </p>
        <p>
            AEAD Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
            Associated Data is optional and sent unencrypted or is implied
            AES-GCM is an AEAD that uses GMAC. Galois/Counter mode.
            It is the TLS standard.
            AES-CTR use AES to encrypt a nonce concatenated with a counter (starting at 1) NOT the plaintext this
            is then used in a similar way to an IV from CBC. A nonce CAN be predictable.
            The nonce+counter encryped is called a keystream and it is XOR'd with the plaintext to produce a cipher
            text
            A nonce in AES-CTR is 96 bits (12 bytes. see js) the remaining 4 bytes (32 bits) serves as a counter,
            the highest values counter is what limits AES-CTR to under 69 GBs. If the keystream is longer than the
            plaintext it is truncated, so no padding is used with AES-CTR so this isn't a block cipher its a
            stream cipher. Compression before encryption opens an attack vector if attacker can influence the
            plaintext
        </p>
        <p>
            GMAC is a MAC constructed from a keyed hash (GHASH)
            This is an almost XOR'd universal hash (AXU) (AKA difference unpredicatable function DUF)
            These hashes dont require collision resistance so are faster.
            To hash something with GHASH the data is broken down into blocks of 16 bytes then hash similar
            to CBC

            Birthday bound, dont use random nonce with same key for more than 2^30 messages
